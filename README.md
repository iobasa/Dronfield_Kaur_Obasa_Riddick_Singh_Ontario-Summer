# Hackathon 2020
## Ontario Tourism Project

Ontario Summer approached us with the task of making their brand integrate with the provincial government, as well as
making their website easy to navigate. New users can sign up to be able to advertise their businesses with us as well
as gain traffic through our partnership with local magazines and newspapers. Prospective customers can also browse
the highlighted logos of local hotspots and go directly to their websites.

## Description

Ontario Summer is the updated version of Destination Ontario, designed for a new decade. Ontario Summer partners with local facilities to showcase Ontario as a four-season must-see travel destination at home and internationally. By tapping into our sophisticated research, international marketing expertise and comprehensive advertising and promotional campaigns, tourism operators and businesses reach markets that otherwise may not be available to them. Thereâ€™s a wide range of exciting opportunities available for partners - large and small - in all markets.
